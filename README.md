**`HS student self-taught developer`**

> Hi, I’m a 16-year-old student who is passionate about deep learning and data science. I have a strong will and desire to learn, I love to study and I value people with good ambitions. I am looking to expand my group of people and connect with people in the field. I would like to share my projects and learn from others on GitHub. Some of the topics I’m interested in are natural language processing, RNNs and Autoencoders. I’m always eager to learn new skills and tools to improve my knowledge and abilities. Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me!

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Personal coding journey</h3></summary>
  I started coding as a young 12-year-old learning from books at the local university. I wanted to learn it all and would spend hours in the library. I had a great hiatus due to not being able to get past some of the harder languages like C. Then I had a great breakthrough around 14 years old when I first started using Linux. I downloaded the Arch ISO and had many problems in my first installation, but then I got the hang of it and started experimenting on computers I built from the electronic trash I found. That’s when I learned all the server-related tools like Nginx, Docker and SSH. It was a great time and I had lots of fun. At around 15, I started taking programming more seriously, doing courses I could afford by private tutoring math and expanding my horizons and setting goals. Now I think I’m ready for the job market and I’m eager to learn more and more.
